# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Port the guild-settings catalogue, 15-second poll contract, cache, sqlx store, and migration to Rust. Runtime ticker and interaction integration remain follow-up work.
- Run isolated settings persistence and concurrency regressions against a disposable Postgres CI service without credentials.

### Fixed

- Detect settings changes with a commit-ordered transactional revision instead of a sequence maximum, including deletes and late commits with lower row versions.
- Serialize settings reads, writes, and audits, including concurrent inserts into absent keys; load cache rows and revision from one consistent database snapshot.
- Refuse environment-only and unknown settings through the cache getter as well as environment snapshots.
- Enforce append-only settings audit data for updates, deletes, and truncation.
