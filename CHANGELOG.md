# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- RSVP domain logic and database store for going, interested and declined responses, namespaced attendance totals, and ManageEvents-gated host check-in facts, with legacy-compatible tables and replies.
- Port website-contract counter, rank and scheduled-events domain logic and transactional storage, with legacy-shaped read views. Runtime job wiring remains deferred.

### Fixed

- Serialize concurrent first RSVP responses before reading the previous status, including when no response row exists yet.
- Fail configured RSVP database-test setup errors instead of silently skipping, and isolate each test invocation in its own schema.
- Preserve isolated bot schemas when applying the website contract, without rebinding the public read views.
- Refuse non-test targets before resetting the website-contract acceptance database.
